# Google Play store AppAnalyser

Now-a-days  large number  of users download and use  Android applications in their day-to-day life from the Google Play store, but negligible information is known on an aggregated level about these apps. This is due to the dearth of tools available for discovering and analyzing Android applications in the Google Play store.

We aim to build an App analyser, a Google Play store scrapper, and use it to index and analyze applications in the Google Play store. It fetches data about various apps in android ecosystem and uses this information to make suitable manipulations.
Also, User reviews of mobile apps often contain complaints or suggestions and feedback which are valuable for app developers to improve user experience and satisfaction as well as end users to choose over a large collection and variety of apps present in Play store. However, due to the enormous collection and unorganized nature of those reviews, manually analyzing them for useful opinions is inherently challenging. 

To address this problem our app does the sentiment analysis of user reviews on play store and compare any two apps on play store.
It allows the app users to search for top apps in a category based on its rating and reviews  and also get to know about similar apps having similar functionality and features in Play store. All these features help the end user to develop his interest in any app catering to his needs.
